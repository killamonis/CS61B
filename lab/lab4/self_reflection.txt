All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A:

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Proud of using the get() method in my resize() method.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My get function is hard to read at first with all the code and encased method calling in one line.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: That there are different solutions to the same problems

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I spent a lot of time trying to figure out the indexes, wrapping around, especially with nextFirst and nextLast in relation to resizing/downsizing. I think it would've been good to know that I just need to have wrapping methods and just utilize those. 

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: In the getRecursive helper function, Anjali mentioned that you could check if you're index is in the back half or front half of the LLD, and then go forwards/backwards based on that. Didn't think of that but it would make my code faster.


Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was happy I figured out my bugs to finish the LLD.


Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My re-routing of pointers in my add/remove functions was pretty weird but it worked out in my mind and on the code so I'll take it.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: yes
