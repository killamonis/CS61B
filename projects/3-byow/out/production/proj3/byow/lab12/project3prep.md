# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: The TA implementation used a lot more abstraction and utilized many separate structures
to build the same method. I need to work on making myself build abstraction in my code to make
it more readable and accessible.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: In the project, the equivalent to a hexagon is a room and a tesselation is the system of 
rooms connected by hallways.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would think about first writing the method for creating rooms and then create the
method for building the system of rooms.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: The two are similar because they are both areas that the avatar can explore.
They are different because a room is a structure of its own and a hallway is a connection between
these different structures.
